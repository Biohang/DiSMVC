This repository contains the source code used in our paper titled DiSMVC: a multi-view graph collaborative learning framework for measuring disease similarity. The code is implemented to realize the proposed predictor, and the dataset and tutorials are also provided to assist users in utilizing the code.

# Introduction
In this study, we propose a novel computational method called DiSMVC to measure disease similarity. DiSMVC is a supervised graph collaborative framework including two major modules cross-view graph contrastive learning and association pattern joint learning. The former aims to enrich disease representation by considering their underlying molecular mechanism from both genetic and transcriptional views, while the latter can capture deep association patterns by incorporating phenotypically interpretable multimorbidities in a supervised manner. Experimental results indicated that DiSMVC can identify molecularly interpretable similar diseases, and the synergies gained from DiSMVC contributed to its superior performance in measuring disease similarity.
